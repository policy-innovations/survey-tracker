<noobcode> Hi
<noobcode> New to IRC, I have a already created django project which i want to run it on localhost on windows
<noobcode> I am using python2.7 and following the documentation i was able to create new project, but i dnt know how to run a existing project
<FunkyBob> noobcode: "python manage.py runserver"
<noobcode> i have tried that
<FunkyBob> but honestly... stop doing your dev on Windows... it only leads to pain
* pantsman (~pantsman@pdpc/supporter/active/pantsman) has joined #django
<noobcode> <FunkyBob> I changed the settings.py file
<noobcode> i have the project in C:/projectname and when i run C:/projectname>manage.py runserver i get error

<noobcode> So all commands so far i've used are without the keyword python. Am a bit confused

<dcrodjer> hi, how exactly do I the djagno sites framework? I want to use multiple (not fixed) number of domains with same project. 
* adesst (~adesst@203.78.122.105) has joined #django
* mbreslin has quit (Quit: Changing server)
<dcrodjer> hence I can't hardcode the site ID
<denysonique> dcrodjer: is the content the same
<dcrodjer> yeah
<denysonique> for each site?
<dcrodjer> basically same models, but mapped site wise
<denysonique> ie?
<dcrodjer> let us say there is a blog app
<denysonique> is www.1.com same as www.2.com? exactly the same?
* mbreslin (term@zorbanation.com) has joined #django
<hvdklauw> dcrodjer: Currently the sites framework is very static (it is loaded based on the SITE_ID settings) but there are people working on making it more dynamic based on the domain used to access it.
<denysonique> if yes, then that is a question related to your server
* olegmilshtein has quit (Quit: olegmilshtein)
<dcrodjer> I have a domain, a.com
<noobcode> denysonique : yes sir,  i understand and i will be moving to linux but right now i need to make some urgent changes to the project and hence i need a workaround for windows
<dcrodjer> and have all the subdomains *.a.com pointed to the project
<denysonique> I think hvdklauw explained everything
<denysonique> dcrodjer: ↑
<denysonique> if that is what you mean
<dcrodjer> hmm
<hvdklauw> if it's only subdomains, don't bother with the sites framework, just parse the subdomain and yourself and do things accordingly
* sshirowork has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
<denysonique> reusing the same application across multiple domains while presenting altered versions of content dependant on the originating domain
<dcrodjer> yeah
<dcrodjer> denysonique, exactly
<StrongOrder> noobcode: make su you have python in you path
<hvdklauw> Write a middleware which sets the request.urlconf if the subdomain is anything but www
<hvdklauw> it's a bit hackish, but works great
<denysonique> middleware... that word is not nice
<denysonique> it sounds java'ish
<dcrodjer> yeah but how do I trigger the comemnts etc according to the site id from middle ware
<denysonique> dcrodjer: using your views
<denysonique> s/using/in
<noobcode> StrongOrder : How do i do that...I have django-admin.py in C:/windows already. And i could also create new project..It is that i want to run this existing project
<hvdklauw> Old article but it explains how it works: http://effbot.org/zone/django-multihost.htm
<dcrodjer> I understand that this could be done otherwise but there isn't any already existing way using the sites framework?
<StrongOrder> noobcode: so your python is already in path. What error do you get?
<dcrodjer> The comments use Sites.get_current right?
<dcrodjer> *django-comments
<hvdklauw> Yes, but that just does a Site.objects.get(id=settings.SITE_ID)
<StrongOrder> noobcode: paste your error at dpaste.com
<noobcode> StrongOrder : I get many errors, one of them is this
<noobcode>  Unhandled exception in thread started by <function inner_run at 0x00D3B5B0>
<noobcode> Traceback (most recent call last):
<noobcode>   File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\django\core\management\commands\runserver.
<noobcode> py", line 48, in inner_run
<noobcode>     self.validate(display_num_errors=True)
* adesst has quit (Quit: Leaving)
<dcrodjer> So I have to customise the comments framework a bit then
<dcrodjer> and flatpages
<dcrodjer> to save site according to the current site (by domain)
<dcrodjer> and same while retrieving from db
* b3hnam (~b3hnam@92.42.55.14) has joined #django
<noobcode> StrongOrder : http://dpaste.com/hold/289739/
<StrongOrder> noobcode: very hard to determine the problem. I suggest you to uninstall systemwide Django, and use virtualenv. Do you need assistance?
* thedvp has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
<dcrodjer> so this is the best way hvdklauw , denysonique ?
<noobcode> Yup..I don't know about this...
<noobcode> StrongOrder : Yup..I don't know about this...
<dcrodjer> Another one I was thinking is to create multiple settings files and use the wsgi script to do the domain checking and targeting correct settings file
<StrongOrder> noobcode: so you're trying to run other's Django code?
<dcrodjer> is there a way to handle domains in wsgi scripts?
<noobcode> StrongOrder : Yes. I have a project already existing, for which i need to make changes
* friskd_ (~friskd_@cpe-76-172-2-7.socal.res.rr.com) has joined #django
<StrongOrder> noobcode: how did you install python? with zip package?
<noobcode> StrongOrder : No..I downloaded the msi installer..It is python 2.7.1
<StrongOrder> noobcode: sorry, I meant Django install?
<hvdklauw> dcrodjer: You could do that, but then it's less dynamic as you need to create the settings file
* sipsniffa has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
<noobcode> StrongOrder : If it helps, the existing project was i think in python 2.5..I am not sure, i just read a comment in settings.py file when editing it
<hvdklauw> You could as the guys of ep.io on how they do the dynamic database settings injection there.. you might then do the same for the SITE_ID
<noobcode> StrongOrder: I got the tar file extracted using 7-zip and ran the command C:/django-1.2.3>setup.py install
<dcrodjer> ep.io?
* lancel has quit (Quit: Leaving)
<dcrodjer> oh hvdklauw saw that
<noobcode> StrongOrder : Also i have not installed this new project. I copied the folder in C:/ drive and then i am trying to run it using command prompt
<dcrodjer> hvdklauw, is there a way for getting wsgi scripts to handle the domains?
<StrongOrder> noobcode: not sure if it's the newer version of Python that's causing problems, there might be other apps that must be there and you don't have
* pantsman has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<hvdklauw> probably, not much into wsgi :)
<StrongOrder> noobcode: can you post you settings file somewhere? make sure to remove passwords in it

<dcrodjer> so I am looking fr a way with django to handle multiple domains
<subsume> many settings.py files
<dcrodjer> yeah ...lets say I generate multiple settings.py files on user signup
<dcrodjer> now how can I write a wsgi script to trigger the correct one according to the domain name?

* drewbert (~drewby@c-76-106-63-237.hsd1.md.comcast.net) has left #django

<dcrodjer> in settings.py
<subsume> that doesn't help you?
<subsume> oh maybe i see what you mean
<dcrodjer> you are saying that I could create multiple settings.py files, but how do I trigger them according to the domainrequest
<subsume> the subdomain could be something dynamic.
<dcrodjer> yeah
<dcrodjer> exactly
<subsume> hmmm i dunno i've never done that. but if i wanted to do it i would probably just check the request object although that could be fudged
<dcrodjer> Till now I have found out this best solution:

* polopollo (~chatzilla@gob75-9-88-178-11-76.fbx.proxad.net) has joined #django
<dcrodjer> define a custom middleware which makes the views available with the important vars which customize the final template according to the domain. And as far as sitemaps and comments is concerned, I will have to customize sitemaps app and a custom sites model on which the other models of sites will be based. And since the comments system is based on the hard-coded sitemap ID I can use it just as is on the models (models will already be filtered according to

<Pewpewarrows> does anyone here have some experience dogfooding their API of a django site?
<Jj> is anyone around using ListView with paginated results?
<jerm> insane_kangaroo:  honestly i dunno… haven't stayed up on dns news, though it's odd that some places would implement it and others woudn't.  perhaps it's meant to deter non-technosavvy sales people / scammers from contacting companies en masse?  ICANN is very much about bugging people to have reliable contact info on the domains, fwiw
<hardwire> dcrodjer: for static files you just change the static file alias for the domain if you're doing domain virtual hosts
<hardwire> outside of django
<dcrodjer> you are not getting me completely
<dcrodjer> I have a django project
<hardwire> me too
<dcrodjer> with some base configuration, models, templates, styles
<dcrodjer> now that project has multiple domainse targeting it 
<dcrodjer> so for each subdomain I wan't to alter the site sligtly, 
<hardwire> just css or more?
<dcrodjer> more
<dcrodjer> css is just a part
<hardwire> what else?.. that's the important part.
<dcrodjer> models
<dcrodjer> lets say I have a blog app

<dcrodjer> now there will be one blog app database, and all the subdmains can access only the db entries corresp to its dmain
<dcrodjer> *domain
<hardwire> dcrodjer: as for static files.. do that in apache by changing the static media alias
<hardwire> as for models.. use the sites framework
<dcrodjer> how can I dynamically change the site ID!
<hardwire> you can change the SITE_ID in settings.py based on wsgi passed variables
<hardwire> OR
<dcrodjer> how
<Epcylon> subsume: ah.. If you remember where did the discussion took place I can try finding out more myself?
<hardwire> you can change it based on the environment

<dcrodjer> I just found out this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3464222/safe-to-modify-settings-site-id-from-middleware-in-django
<dcrodjer> would something like this work?

<dcrodjer> yeah
* stunsch (~stunsch@77.Red-83-45-196.dynamicIP.rima-tde.net) has joined #django
<dcrodjer> close requests can be dangerouse
<hardwire> dcrodjer: add this to your wsgi and start inspecting it yourself
<ramenboy> dcrodjer: you should be able to get the http host using wsgi, if you want to go that route
<hardwire> open('/tmp/wsgi-environ').write(repr(os.ENVIRON))
<ramenboy> the environ argument should have it
<dcrodjer> k
<dcrodjer> I guess handling with the wsgi file would be the best way
<ramenboy> mmmmmm... I'm not so sure that's a good idea, actually
* aphelion has quit (Quit: aphelion)
<ramenboy> the wsgi file is loaded per daemon instance, isn't it?
<dcrodjer> yeah
<dcrodjer> so there will be multiple processes i guess?
<ramenboy> and the usual way to decide what settings file to use is to write to os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE']
<hardwire> maybe not.. but I can't think of a good reason why setting SITE_ID dynamically would have problems even if there are multiple instances going
<ramenboy> which is a global environment variable... no more thread-safe than modifying settings
* bellicose (~bellicose@75-142-245-112.dhcp.reno.nv.charter.com) has joined #django
<ramenboy> hardwire: two requests coming in at the same time?
<dcrodjer> yeah so this isn't thread safe then too
<ramenboy> it depends on whether you're using pre-fork, worker threads, or whatever
<hardwire> ramenboy: site information is stored in the db.
<hardwire> it wouldn't matter if you had 100 servers accessing the DB at once with the same site id
<ramenboy> if you only use pre-fork, you won't have problems, but if there's even the possibility that you might want threads later...
<dcrodjer> I have the django site hosted on a simple apache server with mod_wsgi
<ramenboy> hardwire: settings.SITE_ID is not in the db
<ramenboy> that's the problem
<hardwire> ramenboy: understood
<ramenboy> if you never use settings.SITE_ID, you're fine
<dcrodjer> its hardcoded or in os.environ
<hardwire> setting SITE_ID in settings.py to os.ENVIRON["REAL_SITE_ID"] wouldn't hurt anything
<hardwire> that way you don't need lots of settings.py files
<hardwire> and you can check for the environment variable and assign a default if it doesn't exist
<ramenboy> hardwire: I don't see how you're getting around the thread-safety issue
* gabrielo has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
<hardwire> there is no thread safety issue.
<ramenboy> you just moved the race condition to os.ENVIRON
<dcrodjer> how, the env var will change if two users access two domains
<dcrodjer> at same time
<ramenboy> separate wsgi daemons per domain?
<hardwire> ramenboy: if you run a wsgi instance for each domain it's not a problem
<ramenboy> ahh, ok
<hardwire> however if you wanted to use ServerAlias *.domain.com
<hardwire> you're pooched.
<dcrodjer> I have setup server alias *.domain.com

<dcrodjer> is there a way that I can start a new process if some env var exists
* stunsch has quit (Quit: stunsch)
<ramenboy> dcrodjer: no experience with this, but it supposedly uses threadlocals to get around the issue https://github.com/shestera/django-multisite
<hardwire> if a request comes in for pooched.domain.com it'll come in on *.domain.com which can then render an index page that dispatches a worker process on the server to add pooched.domain.com as a virtual host and reconfigure your web server.
<ramenboy> some people hate threadlocals, I'm not totally sure why
<hardwire> then the next request for pooched.domain.com will go to a brand new shiny wsgi instance.
<dcrodjer> ahh I don't have that much access to the webserver :(
<hardwire> so your catchall domain should go to a server side script or wsgi instance that handles creating a new domain then adding a refresh meta tag.. which is a bit racey

<hardwire> even if you're just querying the domain name information and not using the site manager.
<danols> yes
<hardwire> bbl
<danols> however
<danols> for portabliity and sanity this is the scheme I use
<danols> because what even though your polls is not a 'fully' seperate app yet you just want to drop it into another project and tweak it ?

<mcmuffin> danols: I'm just working through the tutorial and got stranded Q_Q
<danols> you would have to re-write all your imports mysite.polls everywhere
<danols> mcmuffin: tutorial should be cleaned up but I guess we are all just busy coding
* vincentpsarga (~vincent@5ED1CFA5.cm-7-2d.dynamic.ziggo.nl) has joined #django
<danols> so when I code I just always import foo rather than mysite.foo for any app I develop
<danols> than in my wsgi I do this

<danols> sys.path.append('/home/webneger/djcode/mysite')
<dcrodjer> hardwire: thank you very much for your time
<danols> now the reason when you develop on local django server it just auto know everypath
<danols> but in your case notice your URL settings in settings.py
<mcmuffin> along with sys.path.append('/home/webneger/djcode'), or should I remove that?
<danols> it's mysite.url
<danols> so leave sys.path.append('/home/webneger/djcode')

* cilkay (~cilkay@CPE00d0b743a22f-CM0011ae01fcbe.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has joined #django
<mcmuffin> what do you mean by "nocite your url settings in settings.py"?

<tbnorth> trying to iterate related objects in a template, sure I've done this before, but can't get it working: http://pastebin.com/vBtpYajF
<djangoobie> is there a way to filter the choices from a modelForm's foreignkey field, like a custom queryset?
<danols> your ROOT_URLCONF = 'mysite.urls'
<hardwire> dcrodjer: I'm pretty green in my experience with django.. almost everythign I know comes from the djangoproject.com docs
